## [Alpine-Coturn][234]
#### Container for Alpine Linux + Coturn Stun/Turn Server
---

This [image][233] containerizes the [Coturn][135] server to setup
a STUN/TURN gateway for VoIP traffic as a micro service.

Based on [Alpine Linux][131] from my [alpine-s6][132] image with
the [s6][133] init system [overlayed][134] in it.

The image is tagged respectively for the following architectures,
* **armhf**
* **armv7l**
* **aarch64**
* **x86_64** (retagged as the `latest` )

**non-x86_64** builds have embedded binfmt_misc support and contain the
[qemu-user-static][105] binary that allows for running it also inside
an x86_64 environment that has it.

---
#### Get the Image
---

Pull the image for your architecture it's already available from
Docker Hub.

```
# make pull
docker pull woahbase/alpine-coturn:x86_64
```

---
#### Configuration Defaults
---

* Config file loaded from `/var/lib/coturn/turnserver.conf` edit
  or remount this with your own. A default is provided which is
  auto loaded if there aren't any config file to start with.

* Data stored at `/var/lib/coturn`.

* Default configuration listens to ports `3478` and `5349`(TLS),
  for the latter, you need to update the location where your certs
  are in the config file.

---
#### Run
---

If you want to run images for other architectures, you will need
to have binfmt support configured for your machine. [**multiarch**][104],
has made it easy for us containing that into a docker container.

```
# make regbinfmt
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Without the above, you can still run the image that is made for your
architecture, e.g for an x86_64 machine..

This images already has a user `alpine` configured to drop
privileges to the passed `PUID`/`PGID` which is ideal if its used
to run in non-root mode. That way you only need to specify the
values at runtime and pass the `-u alpine` if need be. (run `id`
in your terminal to see your own `PUID`/`PGID` values.)

Running `make` starts the service.

```
# make
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_coturn --hostname coturn \
  -c 256 -m 256m \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  -p 5349:5349/udp -p 3478:3478/udp \
  -p 5349:5349/tcp -p 3478:3478/tcp \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v data:/var/lib/coturn \
  woahbase/alpine-coturn:x86_64
```

Stop the container with a timeout, (defaults to 2 seconds)

```
# make stop
docker stop -t 2 docker_coturn
```

Removes the container, (always better to stop it first and `-f`
only when needed most)

```
# make rm
docker rm -f docker_coturn
```

Restart the container with

```
# make restart
docker restart docker_coturn
```

---
#### Shell access
---

Get a shell inside a already running container,

```
# make debug
docker exec -it docker_coturn /bin/bash
```

set user or login as root,

```
# make rdebug
docker exec -u root -it docker_coturn /bin/bash
```

To check logs of a running container in real time

```
# make logs
docker logs -f docker_coturn
```

---
### Development
---

If you have the repository access, you can clone and
build the image yourself for your own system, and can push after.

---
#### Setup
---

Before you clone the [repo][231], you must have [Git][101], [GNU make][102],
and [Docker][103] setup on the machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/woahbase/alpine-coturn
cd alpine-coturn
```
You can always skip installing **make** but you will have to
type the whole docker commands then instead of using the sweet
make targets.

---
#### Build
---

You need to have binfmt_misc configured in your system to be able
to build images for other architectures.

Otherwise to locally build the image for your system.
[`ARCH` defaults to `x86_64`, need to be explicit when building
for other architectures.]

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 build
# sets up binfmt if not x86_64
docker build --rm --compress --force-rm \
  --no-cache=true --pull \
  -f ./Dockerfile_x86_64 \
  --build-arg DOCKERSRC=woahbase/alpine-s6:x86_64 \
  --build-arg PGID=1000 \
  --build-arg PUID=1000 \
  -t woahbase/alpine-coturn:x86_64 \
  .
```

To check if its working..

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 test
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_coturn --hostname coturn \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  --entrypoint sh \
  woahbase/alpine-coturn:x86_64 \
  -ec 'turnserver -h;'
```

And finally, if you have push access,

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 push
docker push woahbase/alpine-coturn:x86_64
```
